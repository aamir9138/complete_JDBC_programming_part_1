## JDBC in simple way

!["JDBC in simple way"](./pictures/JDBC_in_simple_way.PNG)

- `Ameerpet = javaapplication`
- `xyz place = database`
- `Translator = Driver`
- `Road = connection`
- `vehicle = Statement object` is the vehicle which is used to send the queries from `java application` to the `database` and back.
- `box = ResultSet` is the box which will get the results from database and then stays in the vehicle to be transfered back.
